# CFB Tailgaters

CFB Tailgaters is a social application created with Django that allows college football fans to share photos of their Gameday experience with their followers and other users of the app. 

Whether you want to show off the gumbo your cookin at the tailgate, catch a shot of Rocky Top, or share a picture of the next Heisman winner throwing the pose, snap it, save it, and share it to CFB Tailgaters!
